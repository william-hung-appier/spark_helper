# Icon Setup

You need to create an icon file named `icon.png` in this directory.

The icon should be:

- 48x48 pixels or larger (128x128 recommended)
- PNG format
- Represents the Appier Spark Helper extension

You can:

1. Create a simple icon using any graphics tool
2. Use a placeholder icon temporarily
3. Download a SQL or database-related icon from icon libraries

Until you create the icon, you can use any PNG image and rename it to `icon.png`.
